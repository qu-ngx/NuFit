> NuFit is an application developed by a group of four students from the Google Developer Student Club - DePauw University Chapter. Our app aims to create nutritious and healthy meal plans for anyone who is on a diet by using AI Camera technology to inform on different types of food, helping organize their healthy meals, and providing information through fun quizzes.
